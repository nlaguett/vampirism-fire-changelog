# Orc Race – Design Overview

---

## Race Overview
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Focus:** Strong, sturdy bases with lower damage output
- **Playstyle:** Beginner-friendly, low micro, high macro focus

This race is designed to be as accessible as possible for new players.  
Many buttons and research options have been removed or automated to reduce complexity.

To compensate for these free and automatic upgrades:
- The Orc economy is intentionally slower
- Buildings and upgrades are more expensive

---

## Key Differences
- Walls and offensive buildings are unavailable until the [Barracks] is built  
  *(Encourages proper base setup before spending resources)*

- Starting unit (the Orc “human” / Grunt):
  - **100 *damage***
  - **1000 *range***
  - Same attack speed as Human

- [Worker-Motivation]:
  - Free
  - Automatically unlocked at **minute 3**

- Hero choices are stronger and more combat-oriented

- [Gem-Quality] upgrades:
  - Free
  - Automatically applied at **minute 8**

*(Some of these may only require a short in-game pop-up message rather than full documentation.)*
